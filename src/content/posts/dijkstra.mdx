Happy new year! It's been a while since I wrote anything here, and I thought it
was about time I did so. This time, I'll talk about this really popular, really
important, and really cool algorithm.

One 1956 morning in Amsterdam, a 26-year old [Edsger Wybe Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra) was shopping
with his fiancée. Tired, he sat down on a café terrace todrink a coffee, and
that's when it happened. In twenty minutes, he designed an algorithm that today
is one of the most important ones today, used everywhere from Google Maps to
network packet routing. It is the eponymous Dijkstra's algorithm, used to
find the shortest path between nodes in a graph.

Today, I spent pretty much my entire afternoon trying to understand and implement
it. It was a pretty hard time, but I think I now understand it to a good enough
extent to be able to explain it to y'all here. So here I go.

## Background

As I stated earlier, Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm used to find the
shortest path between graph nodes. Specifically, the graph must be a weighted
one and every weight must be non-negative. This is important, as negative
weights will entirely mess up the algorithm's calculations. There's a different
algorithm called the [Bellman-Ford algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm)
for that purpose. The graph may be either directed or undirected.

## The Algorithm

Let's take this graph:

<Image src={graphImage} alt="An illustration of a graph with four nodes labeled 0 through 4." />

Someone asks you, "Hey, what's the shortest path between 0 and 4?" You can just
take a look at the graph and quickly notice, it's `0-2-4` among the three possible
paths. Let's see how Dijkstra's algorithm helps a computer do this act of noticing.

### Step 1: Prepping for the journey

Create a set of all the unvisited notes, and we'll call it, as expected, the
unvisited set. The data structure to use for this purpose is a priority queue.
Don't worry if that sounds difficult, you can also just use a normal list and 
manage the priority thing yourself, I'll tell you how later on.

```dart
List<DijkstraNode> unvisited = [];
```

You'll also create a map called `predecessor`. This will be important near the
end when we construct the shortest path. Basically, each key in this map
represents a graph node index and each value represents that node's predecessor
node.

```dart
Map<int, int?> predecessor = {};
```

Another list we'll create is this:

```dart
List<DijkstraNode> visited = [];
```

This is something we'll fill with the nodes we visit as we go through the 
algorithm.

Also, just for reference, here is the definition for the class `DijkstraNode`:

```dart
class DijkstraNode {
  GraphNode node;
  int nodeIdx;
  int distance;

  DijkstraNode(this.node, this.nodeIdx, this.distance);

  @override
  String toString() {
    var sb = StringBuffer();
    sb.write("{");
    sb.write("idx: $nodeIdx, dist: $distance");
    sb.write("}");
    return sb.toString();
  }
}
```

It simply holds the node object itself, the index to it, and `distance` which is
something I'll explain in step 2. Alongside those, it has a constructor and a
convenient stringification function.

### Step 2: Initialization

Now, what you'll do is initialize both `unvisited` and `predecessor`.

In this algorithm, we assign each node a `distance`. This is simply the distance
from the source that we have chosen. We start with infinite (or in the case of
this program, very high) initial distances for all nodes; that basically says,
"We don't know the distance yet", and improve these distances as we go on. The
exception is the source node, which always has a `distance` of 0 for obvious
reasons.

Additionally, to begin with, we set each predecessor as `null`.

```dart
for (int i = 0; i < nodes.length; i++) {
  var distance = i == 0
      ? 0
      : 9999999; 
  var uv = DijkstraNode(nodes[i], i, distance);
  unvisited.add(uv);
  predecessor[i] = null;
}
```

### Step 3: Journey begins

We'll now start visiting nodes. We select the current node from the unvisited
set, that is, the node with the smallest `distance` (that's of course, not infinite).

That is the reason why priority queues with the smallest value first are used here,
since the nodes with smaller values get a higher priority.

To begin with, the current node will simply be the source node.

```dart
while (!unvisited.isEmpty) {
  var currentNode = unvisited.removeAt(0);
  visited.add(currentNode);

  // ...
}
```

Note that we've begun a loop. This loop will run as long as there's a node we
haven't visited. As soon as we've visited everything, the loop ends.

Also note that we're removing the current node from the unvisited array. Of
course, that's because since we're visiting it now, it's no longer unvisited.
We'll proceed to add it to the visited list.

One other way the algorithm could terminate would be when I visit the final node.
Now, inherently Dijkstra's is an algorithm which finds the shortest distance to
all nodes from a single one, but if we want to find the distance to just one node,
we can just end it here.

```dart
while (!unvisited.isEmpty) {
  var currentNode = unvisited.removeAt(0);
  visited.add(currentNode);

  if (currentNode.nodeIdx == end) {
      break;
  }

  // ...
}
```

In the case of the above graph, node 0 would be the first `currentNode`.

### Step 5: Hello, Neighbor

The next step is to check out all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node.
We'll calculate the distance to them, by adding the `distance` of the current
node with the weight of the edge that points to the neighbor. Then, we'll
check if that value is less than the current `distance` of the neighbor.

If it is indeed less, we update the `distance` to that newly calculated value.
This is a process known as *relaxation*.

Sounded like a jumble of words? Okay, so here's a portion of the above graph,
consisting only of the connection between nodes 0 and 1 to demonstrate:

<Image src={relaxation} alt="A portion of a bigger graph, with two nodes 0 and 1 separated by a weight of 1." />

1 has a `distance` of infinity because it's set that way to begin with, and node
0 has one of 0 since it's the source. Now, if the function `d(x)` gives the
distance of a node `x` and `u(x, y)` gives the weight of the edge connecting `x`
and `y`, then we can apply this:

```
if d(0) + u(0, 1) < d(1)
    d(1) = d(0) + u(0, 1)
```

As we can see above, `d(0)` is zero, `u(0, 1)` is 1 and `d(1)` is infinity. Hence
the `if` condition is satisfied, and `d(1)` now becomes 1. Node 1 has been *relaxed*.

You use this bit of code to implement this:

```dart
while (!unvisited.isEmpty) {
  // ...
  if (currentNode.nodeIdx == end) {
      break;
  }

  var node = currentNode.node;
  for (var edge in node.edges) {
    // Grab the index of the edge
    var neighborIndex = unvisited.indexWhere((uv) => uv.nodeIdx == edge.to);
    if (neighborIndex == -1) continue; // Already visited
    var neighborNode = unvisited[neighborIndex];

    // Actual relaxation logic
    if (currentNode.distance + edge.weight < neighborNode.distance) {
      neighborNode.distance = currentNode.distance + edge.weight;
      predecessor[neighborNode.nodeIdx] = currentNode.nodeIdx;
    }
  }

  // ...
}
```

This process of relaxation will repeat for every neighbor of the current node
till they're all relaxed.

You might have also noticed this little line there in the relaxation logic:

```dart
predecessor[neighborNode.nodeIdx] = currentNode.nodeIdx;
```

We set the predecessor of a relaxed neighbor to be the current node. We'll be
using these values near the end of the algorithm to construct the path to follow.

#### Fixing our unvisited list

As I said before, the unvisitied list is a priority queue, where the values with
smaller `distance`s get a higher priority. However, after a relaxation, the order
of the elements in this queue of ours, which is just a normal list, by the way,
will be all messed up. We need to fix that.

For this, we just sort in ascending order of `distance`.

```dart
while (!unvisited.isEmpty) {
  // ...
      predecessor[neighborNode.nodeIdx] = currentNode.nodeIdx;
    }
  }

  unvisited.sort((a, b) => a.distance.compareTo(b.distance));
}
```

If you're already using a properly implemented priority queue data structure for
`unvisited`, there's no need to do this since the implementation of that data
structure will handle this issue itself.

Now, the process will repeat from step 3, visiting each node in the graph and
relaxing neighbors. This will continue till all the nodes are relaxed or in this
case, until everything leading upto our target node is relaxed. After that, we'll
end up with all of the `distance` values updated to reflect the shortest possible
distances of each node from the source. These nodes will stay in the `visited`
array.

If we were doing Discrete Math homework, we could just call it quits here. But
we're not done yet. We already know where to find the length of the shortest path;
it's the value of `distance` on our target node in `visited`. However, how do we
find out the path to take to get there?

This is where the `predecessor` map we've looked at a couple of times comes in.

### Step 6: Reconstructing the road

We first create a list to store the path:

```dart
List<int> path = [];
```

It's a list of `int`s, because each node's name is itself an `int`.

What we're basically going to do is begin from the last node, then look at its
predecessor in the `predecessor` map. Then we'll look at that predecessor and so
on, and if a path exists between the source and target nodes, we will have
backtracked our way through the shortest path. And during this backtracking
process, we'll leave each node we backtracked through in the `path` list.

So, to backtrack, we first define this:

```dart
int? current = end;
```

This is a nullable integer, that is essentially our index in a sense to backtrack
using. Now, we do it.

```dart
while (current != null) {
  path.insert(0, current);
  current = predecessor[current];
}
```

While going through the predecessors, we insert each node through the beginning
(as we're going back, not forward) and keep doing this till we reach the
predecessor of the source node 0 itself, which is of course, `null`. It's kind
of like traversing a doubly linked list from its `tail` to its `head`.

Now, this doesn't always succeed. If there's no path that exists between the
source and target nodes, the `path` list will be all messed up. So, we have to
check for that as well.

```dart
if (path.first != start) {
  throw StateError("No path exists from $start to $end.");
}
```

We now grab the *length* of the shortest path from the visited array. It'll just
be the `distance` field of the node whose `nodeIdx` equals to the index of the
target node.

```dart
var pathLength = visited.singleWhere((v) => v.nodeIdx == end).distance;
```

Finally, we're done; we can now return the results. I defined my Dijkstra function
as one that returns a tuple of the path and its length, so I just return this:

```dart
return (path, pathLength);
```

And that's it.

Quite an incredible algorithm, I have to say. If you want to check out my
implementation a bit better, you can take a look at [this link](https://github.com/pes18fan/codedump/blob/main/dsa/algos/dijkstra.dart).

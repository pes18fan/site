<p><b>Hello!</b> Just another random internet guy here. I generally go by 
<b><span class="accented-text">pes18fan</span></b> out here; I've had that name for a while. </p>

<p>I've been programming as a hobby for several years now, but at this point 
working towards making a career through it, studying Computer Engineering.
</p>

<p>I have a deep love for music as well, and I produce some of my own too,
albeit rather amateur. I love reading manga as well.</p>

<p>You can read some of my articles <a href="/posts">here</a> if you wish.</p>

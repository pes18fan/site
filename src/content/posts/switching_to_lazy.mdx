Been a long time since I posted anything! Well, here I am now, bringing you the
story of how I finally decided to drink the Kool-Aid by switching to [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
from packer.

If you didn't know yet, yes I use neovim. Some might claim I'm using it just
to look cool, and to be honest I can't really refute that. Regardless, once I got used to
it I realized there was much more to it than just looking like a CIA hacker.
The efficiency and sheer speed boost you get from switching is ***incredible***,
but I digress. We're here to talk about my package manager switch.

## beginnings with packer

When I first started using neovim for real, I watched [a video by ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE)
where he sets up a nice neovim config using packer with lsp, treesitter, you name it. The
configuration was great, I set it up for myself and changed up a few things as
per my needs. It served me well for a long time, and there wasn't no issue
in particular with it, so one could argue, "why would you need to switch to
lazy in the first place?"

Apparently, lazy is **much** faster than packer, and it also has a nice UI along
with a lockfile system to ensure that your configs don't get messed up if you
switch your device. Those three points were enough to make me switch. Additionally,
packer is not being maintained anymore (which is something I only just realized),
so that's another reason to switch.

## getting started

First thing I did was create a `lazy.lua` file replacing the original `packer.lua`
to place the plugin information in. It begins with this bit of bootstrapping code
from the [lazy.nvim readme](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file#-installation):

```lua
local lazypath = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/lazy/lazy.nvim"
if not vim.loop.fs_stat(lazypath) then
  vim.fn.system({
    "git",
    "clone",
    "--filter=blob:none",
    "https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim.git",
    "--branch=stable", -- latest stable release
    lazypath,
  })
end
vim.opt.rtp:prepend(lazypath)
```

The bootstrapper will ensure that you don't have to reinstall lazy again if
you're on a new system, since it will reinstall itself from here.

I followed this with all of my plugins:

```lua
require("lazy").setup({
    -- plugins here...
    -- for example
    "jiangmiao/auto-pairs",

    -- or for more advanced configuration...
    {
        "nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim",
        dependencies = { "nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons" }
    },
})
```

The configuration for adding a plugin is not much different in packer and lazy,
usually its just some different words. You can check out [this portion of the
lazy.nvim readme](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file#packernvim)
for more information about which packer command is which in lazy, or you can
check out [my own configuration](https://github.com/pes18fan/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/nvim/lua/p18f/lazy.lua)
as a reference.

## lazy loading

One of the best things about lazy.nvim is in its name; it can load plugins
lazily to improve performance. You can set it so that certain plugins only load
when they are needed in the editor. To do this all you need to do is set `lazy`
to `true` when adding a plugin:

```lua
{
    "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim", tag = "0.1.5",
    dependencies = { "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim" },
    lazy = true,
}
```

Another useful option is to set the plugin to load only after a certain event
occurs. For instance, you can set GitHub Copilot to only load after you enter
insert mode:

```lua
{
    "zbirenbaum/copilot.lua",
    event = "InsertEnter",
}
```

There's also a `VeryLazy` option that apparently only loads a plugin once neovim
is fully loaded, but I haven't tried that out yet.

## plugin structuring

[According to the readme for lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file#-structuring-your-plugins), structuring for plugins can be done by using a
Lua module with various files for each module. This is pretty nice since to add
new plugin files all you need to do is add a new file. As I'm adapting 
ThePrimeagen's setup where he put all his plugin configuration in the nvim/after
folder and it still works with lazy, I don't see the need to do this myself.
Perhaps there's better performance or something of that sort, maybe someone can
let me know in the comments.

## super slow startups

After I had set up whatever I had to in lazy and opened neovim with it for the
first time, the startup time seemed to have changed. And not in a good way. In
fact, on checking startup times and comparing with packer's, I discovered
something horrific.

Lazy was making neovim load ***many, many*** times slower than packer.

On checking the startup times, neovim loaded in 65 milliseconds with packer.
But with lazy, it took a ridiculous 1021 (!) milliseconds to load!

Upon further research, I found that for some reason [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter)
was causing the issue. While I tried to figure out how to fix it, eventually the
problem just fixed itself. That was a weird one.

## get rid of packer remnants

One thing that would be good to not forget to do is getting rid of remnants of
packer. If you run `:checkhealth lazy` in neovim, you can see that it will tell
you to get rid of the `packer_compiled.lua` file and the packer files. Just a
little detail to remember.

## conclusion

Well, despite the *really* weird stuff happening at first, switching to lazy
was... pretty easy! I'm not really sure why I was avoiding it so much so far.
I think it's really nice, and at the end of the day, I did get a performance boost!
With packer, as I stated before it took neovim 65 milliseconds to load, but now
with lazy, I got it down to 46. Not a lot, but it's an improvement! Perhaps
I might be able to get it down even further later on as I keep using it, since
I've seen people load neovim in less than 20 milliseconds with a lot more plugins
than I'm using. Hopefully I can figure out some ways to get that to happen.

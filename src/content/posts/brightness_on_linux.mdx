I recently switched entirely to Linux, specifically Arch, due to issues I had
been facing as of late on Windows. When I tried reinstalling Windows, all my
drivers were gone including wifi drivers and I couldn't get them working again,
so I decided to just use Linux where the drivers just worked. Funny, considering
I use an NVIDIA GPU.

Anyways, even before this I had been trying Linux out in dual boot and stuff.
I enjoyed it quite a bit, but there was one glaring issue: brightness couldn't
be adjusted. There didn't seem to be any error or anything that described why
this happened, so I just lived with it while using the
[AlphaTint GNOME extension](https://github.com/saifulbkhan/alpha-tint) to
artificially change brightness.

That was until recently. I assume many of you know of [systemd](https://systemd.io/).
It's a suite of programs that basically opens from the bootloader and starts all
necessary aspects of the system. Some like it, some hate it, I personally don't
care much. Regardless, the hackerman-like wall of text you get in some
distros when they boot up and shut down is a log of what systemd is doing.

Within this wall of text, I, by accident, discovered a bit of text that said "backlight" 
and "nvidia". I instantly realized that this might be a log of an error regarding the
screen backlight, and [of course it's goddamn NVIDIA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYWzMvlj2RQ).
I looked into this, and thankfully found a bit of info from the Arch Wiki about this.
I had to set some kernel parameters to get it to work. Set one of these three and
see which one works:

```
acpi_backlight=video
acpi_backlight=vendor
acpi_backlight=native
```

To set a kernel parameter, first find the configuration file for
your bootloader. In my case, for `systemd-boot`, it should be in `/boot/loader/entries`.
The bootloader config file's name seems to depend on the distro. For Arch Linux, 
most sites will say it's named `arch.conf`, but in my case I used `archinstall`,
so the file was named something like `YYYY-MM-DD_XX-XX-XX_linux.conf`, which includes
the date you installed Arch Linux and the `X`s are replaced with some numbers 
that I couldn't really tell the meaning of. Perhaps they were the time or something.

In my case, the `native` parameter was the one that worked. What a relief.

If it's not working for you still, you can check out the whole [backlight page on
the Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/backlight). Even if you don't use
Arch this may be of help.
